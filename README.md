This program is written in Python. The goal of this program is to find the lowest possible cost of transforming the starting word into the ending word. The following two conditions must be met:
 - Every interim step between the first and the last word must also be a word
 - No interim step can be less than three letters

To run this program, the input must be entered into a file called input. Aditionally, there must be a file named words that contains a list of words to serve as a dictionary. You will only be able to put one set of inputs into the input file.
